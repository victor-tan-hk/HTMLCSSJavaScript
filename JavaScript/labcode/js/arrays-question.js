/* Q1. Create an array of 10 numbers containing random positive and negative numbers. 
Find all the even numbers in this array and sum them up. 
 */


/* Q2. Create an array of 10 numbers containing random numbers. 
Create another array which contains the exact numbers from the first array, but with their order reverse. For e.g. 2,4,6,8 would now become 8,6,4,2.
JavaScript has an inbuilt method to generate random numbers between 1 and x. You can use this in your solution if you wish:

/* Q3. Create an array of 20 numbers containing random numbers, where some of these numbers are repeated: for e.g. 3, 5, 8, 5, 9, 3, etc. 
Identify the numbers that are duplicated and how many times they are duplicated (once, twice, three times, etc)

/* Q4. Create 2 arrays with 10 elements each containing random strings (for e.g. names of animals, cities, cars, people, etc). 
Ensure that there are a few strings which are identical in these 2 arrays. Identify identical strings in both these arrays.

/* Q5. Create an array of 10 numbers containing random numbers. 
For every number that is more than 50, replace that number in its position with the number 888.

/* Q6. Repeat Q3, except this time, delete the duplicate numbers, so that each number only appears exactly once in the array.
 */



/* Q7. Create an array of 5 elements containing string descriptions of numbers between 1 and 10, for e.g. ["six", "five", "three", "nine", "two"]. 
Using the map higher order array function, create a new array whose contents are the numerical equivalents of those string descriptions, for e.g. [6, 5, 3, 9, 2]
 */


/* Q8. Create a 2-dimensional array with 3 rows and 5 columns containing random numbers. 
Find the largest / smallest number in each row.
 */



/* Q9. Extend the solution for Q1 from objects-question.js so that the customer record now looks like this. 
Use arrays to appropriate model the additional information provided. Ensure you include at least 3 items for the customer to purchase.

There is a new condition in place on the use of Shopee Coins.

The customer can only pay using Shopee Coins if this is included as one of his possible methods of payment AND the item(s) that he wishes to use Shopee Coins on has a rating of 4.5 and above.

Modify the previous method that you implemented to check again whether the customer is able to pay for part of his overall purchase using Shopee Coins alone. The cash equivalent of the Shopee Coins is obtained by multiplying it with the Coin conversion rate.

Call the object method and change the values for the possible methods of payment and rating for specific items being purchased to verify that it works correctly.
