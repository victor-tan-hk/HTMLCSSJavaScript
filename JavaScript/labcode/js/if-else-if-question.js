/* Q1: Create two variables and store random numbers in them (which can be either 0, positive or negative). Display the larger of these two numbers, and if they are equal, indicate that as well.
 */


/* Q2: Create two variables and store random numbers in them (which can be either 0, positive or negative). Display the sign of the multiplication product of the two numbers. For e.g. if the first number is +ve and the second number is -ve, then the multiplication product is -ve (so you display the message negative or -ve). For your solution, you can write a statement to multiply the two variables using the * operator
 */


/* Q3: Repeat Q2 but WITHOUT using a statement to multiply the two variables using the * operator
 */




/* Q4: Create 3 variables and store random numbers in them (which can be either 0, positive or negative). Display the variable with the largest value
 */


/* Q5: Repeat Q4 except now display the variable with the smallest value
 */



/* Q6: Create 3 variables and store random numbers in them (which can be either 0, positive or negative). Print out the variables in ascending order of their values (from smallest to largest)
 */



/* Q7: Repeat Q6 but print in descending order (largest to smallest)
 */



/* Q8: The algorithm for calculating whether a year is a leap year or not is outlined here:

Create a variable to store a year as a number, and then indicate whether the year is a leap year or not
