Create an object with suitable properties to model this customer (which may include other objects as well).

Add a method to this object that will check whether the customer is able to pay for the item purchased using the Shopee Coins alone. The cash equivalent of the Shopee Coins is obtained by multiplying it with the Coin conversion rate.

Call the object method and change the values for the Shopee Coins and Coin conversion rate to verify that it works correctly.
